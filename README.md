My name is Tuxilio and I’m strong supporter of free software. Because of this, my activity on GitHub is limited. I only use it to contribute to other free software projects like Minetest.

**You will not find my own code here.** (No, forks created exclusively for pull requests don’t count.) My own code is hosted on **[Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/Tuxilio)**.

## GitHub is bad
**I reject GitHub** because [GitHub is not free software](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/essays/github/) and suffers from [the JavaScript Trap](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html).

The JavaScript Trap is **a huge deal**, actually. It has de-facto **normalized** webbrowers shipping proprietary code to its users. While we can’t fix the web, we *can* fix our workflows in our own software projects by removing proprietary software from **all** steps in our workflow.

If the free software movement wants to truly win, we have to go **free software all the way**. It is unacceptable we’re tolerating a massive proprietary platform like GitHub and have integrated in our workflow so deeply.

### Moving away from GitHub

**If your project is on GitHub and you care about freedom, please consider migrating to a free platform.** The more people embrace *actual* freedom, the easier it will become for all of us.

**I recommend [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)** It runs Forgejo, has a very similar interface, easy migration and is very stable. I have had *very* good experience with it.

Before you actually migrate, please make sure to read their documentation first in order to avoid ugly surprises.

Alternatively, consider self-hosting.
